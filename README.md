Computer habit detection system.

Idea:

Design and build a decentralised and personalised mobile phone application for supporting learners that stores learner artefacts (or links to them) as well as assessment results, chronological information, etc. and allows for real-time feedback about informal learning in situ – documenting “aha moments”. Then the information stored locally should be sent when needed to the School, but the whole idea would be to avoid a centralized server or learning management system. The assessment and credentialing could be based on the Open Badges stuff. The app should enable Grindr-like localization and selection of peers – find someone to learn with close by, and hook up with them (to study, of course).
Digital volunteering – how could you use a decentralized app that plugs into your social networks to foster and support volunteering? Individual organizations have their own online systems to support their volunteers, but how could you help people who volunteer connect to each other, rather than rely on hierarchical structures of their respective organizations. The focus here could be on disaster risk reduction and community resilience – relevant in places that are seeing increasing frequency in disasters (think Philippines) and that have fairly good connectivity
On humanitarian interventions, there is a need for tools to improve data collection in markets before, during and after disasters, i.e. with efforts focused on helping to rebuild or support markets and communities rather than flying in relief goods at high cost. Last year it was built a learning system to teach analysis and other critical thinking skills in such contexts, but when organizations support local traders, they are still doing data collection using pen and paper. IFRC has scaled up use of a tool called RAMP so it may be as simple as figuring out how to adapt this tool and teach it to traders.
Learning evaluation - When FTF in-service training happens, it would be amazing to have an app to use as clickers and to do more in-depth survey collection. Now that 20$ smart phones are a reality, we may no longer need to use SMS to do things like this.

FireChat. It is an instant messaging app recently used in the Hong Kong protests when wifi and other networks were being jammed, as it uses Bluetooth as a fallback to exchange messages when no other network is available. In disaster contexts, how could you get this app onto the phones of people who did not download it?
Build a mobile app for traders to record prices and keep Basic accounts. In emergencies this is a problem in west African markets.
Personal emergency for a person with disabilities: it could be a mobile app tracking any abnormal variation in the accelerometer and if one such variation is recorded that is beyond a specific threshold, propose to the owner to send an emergency message to predefined contacts; if the user doesn’t cancel the action in a minute, then the message is sent. This avoids notifying in case of false emergency situations.
Disaster relief: build an app that monitors weather warnings in the area in which you are; if a tornado/snowstorm/tsunami warning is issued, communicate some information about the current location and maybe identification of the phone’s owner, and activate battery saving mode on the phone. This could act as a beacon, and there could also be a way for the user to react if he/she is not on a real emergency situation.


Design and build an app for an evacuation plan in a big city (eg London) when a disaster strikes. Think about how people will leave the city by car, public transport.  How to issue timely traffic advisories (eg what roads are blocked or jammed).  Your plan could be to encourage people to tweet or text about traffic conditions.  Devise a way to incorporate this into social networks, mapping applications, broadcast media.
Flu Tracking in the Social Age
We all get sick, and we all pass on our colds to the people we know, but what if we could track the spread?
From the user’s perspective: Track your symptoms and medicine intake in-app. Get tips and encouragement. Tell the app if you infect someone you know – send them an app invite and they will be able to do the same.
From the administrator’s perspective: Unprecedented depth of data collection in real time about flu around the globe. Track particularly nasty strains of flu by location in real-time. See how flu spreads through a social circle.
a mentoring matching service that creates 'knowledge sharing experiences' between people - so young people going out in the field can send a request to find people with related experience  to get advice, up-to-date information and specific details. 
Infectious Disease Tracking in Humanitarian Crises
Infectious diseases often contribute to the human cost of a humanitarian emergency. The goal of this application is to provide an effective way for humanitarian aid workers to visualize the spread of various infectious diseases throughout the affected region. (example map ) 
Tech stack:
Bokeh, Flask, maybe deployed to Heroku


Create a time banking web/mobile app that people can use to exchange services without money. Each person can offer services to the community and build up credit and subsequently spend this credit on services offered to him or her. Location information can be used to optimise matching between members of the community. Also see http://www.timebanking.org/.
Most humans depend heavily on using computers in the day to day lives. Without realising it, your eyes get strained, sometimes you build up health issues from slouching, not moving from the computer for hours, to not blinking and so much more. WE propose to build an desktop app that helps humans live a better day to day life by giving you hints when you violate something that. e.g. you haven't blinked in a while, haven't moved in a while, are slouching.

Skills and potential Scoping
* Potential Demos - Desktop - Java, There is a library called OpenCV that does facial and eye detection. We could detect how many blinks you do per minute. and tell you if that's below the average.

If we are being ADVENTUROUS we detect when you are slouching and send a notification to the user to tell you that you need to sit straighter  ;)


If we are VERY ADVENTUROUS we could detect when you last moved your face, when you last moved from the computer etc etc ;)

Ideally this should be a background app that is always running on your computer but for demo purposes we could make it a normal desktop app with a UI.
