# Idea:

Most humans depend heavily on using computers in the day to day lives. Without realising it, your eyes get strained, sometimes you build up health issues from slouching, not moving from the computer for hours, to not blinking and so much more. WE propose to build an desktop app that helps humans live a better day to day life by giving you hints when you violate something that. e.g. you haven't blinked in a while, haven't moved in a while, are slouching.

Skills and potential Scoping
* Potential Demos - Desktop - Java, There is a library called OpenCV that does facial and eye detection. We could detect how many blinks you do per minute. and tell you if that's below the average.

If we are being ADVENTUROUS we detect when you are slouching and send a notification to the user to tell you that you need to sit straighter  ;)


If we are VERY ADVENTUROUS we could detect when you last moved your face, when you last moved from the computer etc etc ;)

Ideally this should be a background app that is always running on your computer but for demo purposes we could make it a normal desktop app with a UI.
